## Setup for local running
#### 1. Install node.js 
#### 2. clone the repo and install dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/jay-repos/social-app-cool social-app-cool
cd social-app-cool
npm install
```
beacause the semantic-ui modules reqiures react@17 and we are using react@18 here,we we add "--force".
(ps. You can simply choose react@17)
```
npm i semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css --force
```
#### 3. create a firebase project and enable servives include email authentication, firestore database, storage.
Add the code below to src/utils/firebase.js
(you can get your firebaseConfig after seting your firebase project,
and paste your config in this file.)
```javascript
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import firebase from "firebase/compat/app";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: ***,
  authDomain: ***,
  projectId: ***,
  storageBucket: ***,
  messagingSenderId: ***,
  appId: ***
};

// Initialize Firebase
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export default firebase
```
#### 4. start running
```
npm start
```
